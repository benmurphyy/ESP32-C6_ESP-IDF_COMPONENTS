# Welcome
Thanks for visiting and hope you find something useful.  The code base is maintained as well as one person can manage in their spare time. The development environment is under Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO (6.1.16) and ESP-IDF (v5.3.1) extensions.  There is always room for improvement to optimize the code base and open to suggestions.

# ESP32-S3 Components
PlatformIO components with examples for the ESP32-S3 chipset.  This is a revised release utilizing esp-idf suggested design patterns through `handles` and using `i2c_master.h` for I2C transactions.  The drivers are organized in the components folder within the Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO environment.

The folder structure for components, and its associated example, are outlined as follows:
```
|--components
|  |
|  |--peripherals
|  |  |
|  |  |--adc
|  |  |--i2c
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |--esp_bmp_280
|  |  |  |  |- BMP280 Datasheet.pdf
|  |  |  |  |- bmp280.c
|  |  |  |  |- bmp280.h
|  |  |  |  |- CMakeList.txt
|  |  |  |  |- LICENSE
|  |  |
|  |  |--owb
|  |  |--spi
|  |
|  |--engineering
|  |--schedule
|  |--storage
|
|--include
|  |- app_config.h
|  |- bmp280_task.h
|
|--src
|  |- bmp280_task.c
|  |- main.c
|
|- platformio.ini
```
To get started, locate and open the `app_config.h` file from the `include` folder and configure GPIO pins as needed.  Now, locate and open the `main.c` file from the `src`folder and go to the `void app_main( void )` subroutine to enable the device of interest.
```
/**
 * @brief Main application entry point.
 */
void app_main( void ) {
    /* start a component example */
    /* note: only one component can run at a time */
    
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_AHTXX);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_AS7341);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_BH1750);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_BMP280);
    i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_BMP390);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_CCS811);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_ENS160);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_HDC1080);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_HMC5883L);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_MLX90614);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_MPU6050);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_SGP4X);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_SHT4X);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_SSD1306);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_TLV493D);
    //i2c0_component_example_start(I2C_COMPONENT_VEML7700);
}
```
Once these initial steps are done, compile and upload the program, assuming your development board is equivalent to the `esp32s3box`.  Otherwise, you will have to configure the environment for your development board and recompile before uploading the program.

# ESP Peripheral Components (ADC, I2C, OWB, SPI)
The ESP peripheral components accomodate ADC, I2C, OWB, and SPI device interfacing supported by various device manufacturers.

Supported drivers include the following device peripherals:
 
 - ADC: Roithner LaserTechnik GUVA-S12SD
 - I2C: ASAIR AHTXX
 - I2C: AKM AK8975
 - I2C: OSRAM AS7341

Above peripheral drivers have been tested, validated with a logic analyzer where applicable, and still under development. With every ESP-IDF release there are bound to be quirks with the code base, a major one was with the release of ESP-IDF (v5.3.1), the i2c_master.h introduced timing issues and above drivers did require some maintenance.  If any problems arise please feel free to log an issue and if you would to contribute please contact me.

# ESP Engineering Components
The ESP engineering components are generally used in conjunction with peripheral components for data processing.

Supported components include the following:

- `Kalman Motion`: Kalman filter for motion based use-cases that leverage sensors such as a gyroscope and/or accelorometer.
- `Sensirion Gas Index Algorithm`: A gas index algorithm for Sensirion air quality sensors.  This code base is maintained by Sensirion.

See Sensirion SGP4X example on how the gas index algorithm is utilized with this sensor.

# ESP Schedule Components
The ESP `time-into-interval` component synchronizes a FreeRTOS task with the system clock and user-defined time interval for temporal conditional scenarios.

# ESP Storage Components (WORK IN PROGRESS)
The ESP storage components can be used for use-cases that require volatile and/or non-volatile storage.

Supported components include the following:

- `Data-Logger`: A user friendly table based data logging component for measurement and control use-cases.  See Data-Logger examples for more details, see readme file in the component folder.
- `NVS Ext`: A component extension that simplifies the process of reading and writing information to non-volatile storage (NVS).  See readme file in the component folder.
